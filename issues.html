          <h2>Homeless & Mental Health</h2>
          <p class="text-left">As a resident of First Hill, I have been spit on, grabbed, and verbally assaulted by members of the homeless population. Conversely, around the country we have seen people randomly assault sleeping homeless people on the street. With so many people on the streets, Seattle has an unsafe environment for the entire population. We were led to believe that the city was working on fixing the homeless situation, but things have not been effective enough so far. I believe that a large part of the situation at hand is due to mental health problems that go untreated or undertreated.</p>
          <p class="text-left">If I were so lucky as to be elected your state representative, I would expand funding for mental health treatment to increase the safety of our streets and get people the help they need. Because I believe that the private sector always does a better job than government can, I would work to get funding for charitable organizations, religious organizations, and other groups that have a mission to protect the poor. I would make it a priority to address the situation at hand to improve the lives of all of us who all the 43rd Legislative District home.</p>

          <h2>Wages and Affordability</h2>
          <p class="text-left">While the Fight for 15 certainly has noble intentions, the unfortunate impact for many employees will be losing their jobs. Companies with slim margins will be forced to cut employees and replace them with technology, raise prices significantly, or close down completely. The free market works better than a government mandate, but Seattle has spoken and the law is the law. In order to mitigate job losses, the state legislature must treat franchises as small businesses and give them time to adjust their business models and phase in the wage increase.</p>
          <p class="text-left">If elected as your representative, I would take measures to promote and spotlight businesses that provide good paying jobs for workers without punishing those who don’t. I believe wholeheartedly that the impact of voting with your dollars is more effective than having government arbitrarily set minimum wage floors. I will fight for employers and employees alike, getting government out of the way so Washington can prosper.</p>

          <h2>Environment</h2>
          <p class="text-left">From the first time we came to Seattle, my wife and I instantly fell in love with Lake Union, Green Lake, and the western shore of Lake Washington. Growing up hunting, fishing, and playing in the woods, I was amazed at the wonderful array of local, state, and national parks in the PNW. The city view you see when coming into the city – from either direction on I-5 – will never cease to amaze me. Such an abundance of natural resources should be harnessed for renewable energy and maintained for future generations to experience the same great outdoors we enjoy today.</p>
          <p class="text-left">I believe that we should channel our inner Theodore Roosevelt and promote the creation and preservation of parks and outdoor areas. With such a diverse range of ecosystems across the state, we can provide great educational opportunities to our youth and opportunity for exercise for all ages. As your state representative, I would make it my duty to provide responsible conservation practices without prohibiting economic growth.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="icon-circle">
            <span class="fa-stack fa-5x">
              <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x" id="outer-icon"></i>

          </div>
          <h2>Individualism</h2>
          <p class="text-left">When I look across the aisle, it seems as if everyone running is an activist of some sort (be it gay, trans, or other). It is sad that people feel as if they need to elect an activist for their individual cause or belief system or risk having their rights violated. I would aim to start a movement toward a Republican Party that defends the rights of the LGBTQ community as human rights rather than a scary, progressive ideal. To a different end, I think it is ridiculous that Washington chooses to regulate fantasy football as if it were a crime! You know the state has too much of a tendency to seek control when there are bills in circulation right now that seek to control fantasy sports down to the exact dollar amount. I firmly support SB 6333 to classify one day, individual performance related fantasy sports as a game of skill rather than chance. We don’t need a nanny state to grant us our natural rights; we really need laws to make sure that the government can’t take our rights away.</p>
          <p class="text-left">In the spirit of individualism and of the Constitution, we should all support the rights of individuals to live life with the freedom endowed upon us by God and nature. As your representative, I would promise to support the various causes of liberty and freedom throughout the state as well as any reasonable activist would. I am of the belief that no cause of liberty is too big or too small to take on.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p class="text-left">As a product of public schooling all the way through college, I know the great service to the community that quality public schooling can provide. As an aerospace employee, I also see how valuable a technical skill can be. There are many jobs in Washington that a 4-year bachelors program doesn’t and can’t prepare you for. Washington has an abundance of students in community colleges and technical schools, but they are underfunded as we currently sit.</p>
          <p class="text-left">I support healthy state funding for the many faces of education because I believe it is both a vehicle to move people out of poverty and a requirement to having a vibrant, growing economy. Charter schools, alternative and technical schools, and well-funded public schools are necessary for the state and as your representative I would fight to make sure they are more than adequately funded.</p>

          </div>
          <h2>Transportation</h2>
          <p class="text-left">Seattle is an absolute mess when it comes to travel. Commuting on I-5 or I-90 is enough to make anyone tear their hair out. Decades of shortsighted city planning and highway design have made it terribly difficult for people to get to and from work. With hundreds of millions of dollars and countless hours wasted on commuting related issues every year, we need state government to focus on finding solutions.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Using the generous amount of money collected from private citizens and businesses through taxation in this state, government should work to facilitate efficient and timely travel opportunities throughout Puget Sound and the entire state. I would prioritize working on solutions to the pending crisis at hand as Seattle and Bellevue grow even further.</p>
