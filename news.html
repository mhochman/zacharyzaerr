            <h2 class="blog-post-title">First Endorsement - Mainstream Republicans of Washington State</h2>
            <h5 class="blog-post-date">June 15, 2016 by Zachary</h5>
            <p>I'm proud to announce I've officially received my first endorsement! Being a late entrant to the race, I'm doing my best to garner some attention from various political, trade, and business groups that endorse candidates. While I consider myself to be more on the libertarian side of the Republican party, I was able to receive the endorsement of the Mainstream Republicans of Washington State today. I believe wholeheartedly in their four main issues -- jobs and prosperity, fiscal conservatism, education, and socially moderate policy.</p>
            <p>Too often nowadays we see people who misunderstand the free market for being a negative for certain groups of people. To the contrary, fiscal conservatism and reduced regulation will grow jobs and salaries for all people. Classical liberal economic policies are responsible for the greatest explosion of wealth mankind has ever seen. Please join me on the campaign trail at one of the various debates to hear why I know the free market is the best thing for all of us.</p>
            <p>Education is vitally important to the future of our state. We need to fully fund public education as required by the Supreme Court's McCleary decision. In my view, this should include adequate funding for trade or vocational schools, community colleges, and traditional four year universities alike.</p>
            <p>Spreading the message of inclusive social policy and free market economics is extremely important, and I'm glad to have the support of a group that has a mission to do just that. </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">My Plan to become the 43rd Legislative District State Representative</h2>
            <h5 class="blog-post-date">May 15, 2016 by Zachary</h5>
            <p>Money in politics is a scary thing to many people. For over a decade in the 43rd Legislative District, many candidates have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars every cycle to inundate the airwaves, television, sidewalks, and newspapers with advertising. I will start out seeking to raise $4,999 in order to be under the small-dollar limit for financial reporting. After that, I will be seeking to raise money for local charities and organizations that help solve the issues that I have outlined as important problems facing the district. This way, no matter how big I win, or how badly I lose, I will be able to positively impact the community here. I ask for your support in helping me mold the future of Washington into one that promotes equality of opportunity rather than outcome, drives free-market solutions to our problems, gets rid of government waste, and preserves our wonderful natural resources.</p>
            <p>I believe that even though I will raise at least a couple hundred thousand dollars less than my opponents, my message of economic opportunity and prosperity, cleaning up our streets and raising people out of poverty, and responsible environmental activity will resonate with the people of this district. If you agree please join my mailing list or my volunteering list – I look forward to meeting you and working alongside you to make this district and state even better and more prosperous.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Washington state must make a stand against Donald Trump</h2>
            <h5 class="blog-post-date">May 6, 2016 by <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/" target="_blank">The Seattle Times</a></h5>
            <p>WASHINGTON Republicans still can make a statement in the May 24 presidential primary. Donald Trump will come into it short of the 1,237 delegates he will likely win to secure the party nomination.</p>
            <p>But giving him Washington’s 44 delegates would be antithetical to the state’s interests.</p>
            <p>Trump’s lack of understanding of foreign policy, his divisive campaign rhetoric and behavior, and his reluctance or inability to discuss policies behind his outrageous fantasies disqualify him as presidential material.</p>
            <p>Republican voters should follow the lead of Chris Vance, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, who says he will vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primary. Kasich dropped out of the presidential race this week, but his name will still be on the ballots arriving in the mail soon.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why I’m running for state representative</h2>
            <h5 class="blog-post-date">May 1, 2016 by Zachary</h5>
            <p>I’m running to be your state representative because the current state of politics scares me, quite frankly. I know a Republican candidate is a tough sell in Seattle, but I want to help mold the future of the Republican Party into one that is inclusive, positive, and supports pro-growth free market policies to lift all groups of people. I see a lot of problems around the district and state that can be tweaked to make this place even better. I don’t know if there’s anywhere else in the world that I can be at a freshwater and saltwater beach, tasting wine at a beautiful winery, hiking on a green mountain, skiing on a beautiful snow covered mountain, or having happy hour in a major city all within an hour and a half! Because I’m so passionate about Seattle, I want to make this place the best it can be.</p>
            <p>My main policy goals, which you can check out on my issues page, will focus on:</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">1.  Improving the homeless situation that plagues downtown Seattle currently. I’ve seen some very mentally unstable people roaming the streets that are a danger to themselves and others. We need to increase mental health funding and provide those who are sick the help they need. It’s inhumane and benefits no one to leave them on the streets like we currently do. I would hope to work with local charities and shelters to help solve the crisis at hand.</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">2.  Improving the business climate in the state, getting government out of the way of small businesses, and broadly promoting sensible free market policies. I hope to convince some former socialist voters, democrats, and big government republicans of the fact that classical liberal economics are responsible for lifting more people out of poverty and into prosperity than any other economic system. Capitalism provides equality of opportunity for all when not burdened by government and political pressures.</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">3.  Preserving the environment for future generations while working to help businesses thrive throughout the state. This would include common sense transportation solutions as well as state parks and improving river and lake health around the state.</p>
            <p>Too often Democrats and Republicans alike overregulate and then blame businesses for skirting around the bad regulations they put in place. Too often both parties support policies that take rights away from certain people groups without respect for the Constitution. Regardless of party affiliation, our founding documents are clear that all people are created equal and are endowed with unalienable rights. I’m running for State Representative to create a positive vision for the future, in stark contrast to the Democrats and Socialist Alternative parties here that tell you that government is always the solution, when in reality it is almost always the problem. Similarly, the Republican Party has previously worked to deny people rights when the Constitution would say otherwise. I look forward to getting to know more people around the district in the coming months! Talk to you soon!</p>
